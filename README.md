# ShaderRinth

This program should fulfill the purpose of quickly
generating various procedural textures per written
shader code.

For instance, one could write code that procedurally
generates some wood pattern and the program should
take care of its outputs in normals, diffuse, etc.

For that workflow to be applicable, the software
should be relatively easy to use and offer various
presets so that the user can iterate on their ideas
faster.

## Goal posts

* Integrate more powerful code/text editor [done]

* Create framework for shaders/materials/configurable uniforms etc. [wip]

* Node based editor for shader passes / uniforms / textures [wip]

* Ability to save/load renders and shader projects

* Load textures & configure as uniforms

* Manage multiple shader passes

* UI improvements

* ...
